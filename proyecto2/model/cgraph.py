        1. Initialize a union-find structure to manage connected components.
        2. Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.  
        3. Iterate through the sorted edges and for each edge:
            a. Check if the endpoints of the edge belong to different components using the union-find structure.
            b. If they do, add the edge to the MST and union the components.
        4. Stop when the number of edges in the MST is equal to the number of vertices minus one.
        5. Return the edges in the MST.

        Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
        This implementation uses a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently retrieve the next vertex with the smallest distance.
        1. Initialize a distance dictionary with all vertices set to infinity, except the source vertex which is set to 0.
        2. Create a priority queue (min-heap) and add the source vertex with distance 0.
        3. While the heap is not empty:
            a. Pop the vertex with the smallest distance from the heap.
            b. If the vertex has already been visited, continue to the next iteration.  
            c. For each incident edge of the vertex, calculate the alternative distance to the opposite vertex.
            d. If the alternative distance is smaller than the current known distance, update the distance and 
                                                    add the opposite vertex to the heap with the new distance.
